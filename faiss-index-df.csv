TripAdvisor is perfect example of too many people with too much time on their hands. Quick to complain but wouldn't think to review having experienced the opposite. Great site for guidance however keeping in mind it is mainly personal preference apposed to complete accuracy.,5,84,35.8.1,2020-03-25 01:40:35,,,35.8.1
